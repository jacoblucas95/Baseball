This app allows you, the user, to test certain betting strategies on MLB games from the past 10 years.  This app returns an API which serves on http://localhost:5000. The routes to access API data may be found in run/flask_app/routes.py. To acces information different from the get request, you may send a post request to the server. The post request requires a JSON object with a schema:
{'start_date': ,'end_date': ,'bet_type': ,'strategy': }.  Dates must be in unix time, bet_type can be 'ml', 'rl', or 'ou' for moneyline, runline, or over/under, respectively, and startegy may be 'home', 'visitor', 'favorite', 'underdog', etc. Please have fun with this app and I hope you enjoy it!
